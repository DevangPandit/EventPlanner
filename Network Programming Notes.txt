Topology - The physical layout of the network
Thin-net or 10 base 2 or 10 baseband 2 (200 metres and 30 computers per segment)
Thick-net or 10 base 5 or 10 baseband 5 or backbone cable (500 metres and 100 computers per segment)
star or 10 base T or baseband twisted pair (100 computers per segment)
Switches cables
i) UTP - Unshielded Twisted Pair
ii) STP - Shielded Twisted Pair
This cables are folded because of EMI (Electro Magnetic Interface), more twisted less EMI

Hubs - half duplex
Switches - full duplex
